def tqwt(x: np.ndarray, q: float, redundancy: float, stages: int) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Tunable-Q Wavelet transform TODO: more docs for tqwt

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: array like, shape (n,)
        Input signal, needs to be of even length
    q: float
        Q-Factor. The Q-factor, denoted Q, affects the oscillatory behavior the wavelet; specifically, Q affects the
        extent to which the oscillations of the wavelet are sustained. Roughly, Q is a measure of the number of
        oscillations the wavelet exhibits. For Q, a value of 1.0 or greater can be specified. The definition of the
        Q-factor of an oscillatory pulse is the ratio of its center frequency to its bandwidth.
    redundancy: float
        Oversampling rate (redundancy). Redundancy of the TQWT when it is computed using
        infinitely many levels. Here `redundancy means total over-sampling rate of the transform (the total number of
        wavelet coefficients divided by the length of the signal to which the TQWT is applied.) The specified value of
        must be greater than 1.0, and a value of 3.0 or greater is recommended. (When it is close to 1.0, the wavelet
        will not be well localized in time â€” it will have excessive ringing which is generally considered undesirable.)
        The actual redundancy will be somewhat different than the parameter because the transform can actually be
        computed using only a finite number of levels.
    stages: int
        The number of stages (or levels) of the wavelet transform is denoted by stages. The transform consists of a
        sequence of two-channel filter banks, with the low-pass output of each filter bank being used as the input to
        the successive filter bank. The parameter `stages` denotes the number of filter banks. Each output signal
        constitutes one subband of the wavelet transform. There will be J + 1 subbands: the high-pass filter output
        signal of each filter bank, and the low-pass filter output signal of the final filter bank.

    Returns
